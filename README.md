# Overview

This project provides a template for generating an FPGA bitstream for a Verilog based design for Tiny Tapeout.

# What is Tiny Tapeout?

TinyTapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital designs manufactured on a real chip.

To learn more and get started, visit https://tinytapeout.com.

# How to Use this Template

## 1. Create your design

Develop your Verilog design using a local or web-based IDE.  Simulate your design to ensure it functions properly.

To program the FPGA demo board with your design, follow the next set of instructions.

## 2. Clone this repo

Create a GitHub account if you don't have one.  Log into your account and select the 'Use this template' button in the 
upper right to clone a new copy of this repo in your GitHub account.

## 3. Enable GitHub actions to build the results page

- [Enabling GitHub Pages](https://tinytapeout.com/faq/#my-github-action-is-failing-on-the-pages-part)

## 4. Edit info.yaml

Edit the [info.yaml](info.yaml).  Set the following parameters in the file:

```
project:
  wokwi_id:  0
  source_files:
    - top.sv  # for designs generated by Makerchip
    - [file#1.v]
    - [file#2.sv]
  top_module: tt_um_template  # for designs generated by Makerchip 
  
documentation: 
  author:       "Your name here"                   # Your name
  title:        "Verilog FPGA bitstream"           # Project title
  language:     "Verilog"                          # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "The project generates an FPGA bitstream for a Verilog based Tiny Tapeout design."      # Short description of what your project does

```

## 5. Update / add your Verilog files

For designs generated by Makerchip, replace the file top.sv with your System Verilog.

For other Verilog designs, add or update the top module verilog file plus any others used in the design.

Commit all changes to the remote repo.

## 6. Generate and download your FPGA bitstream

Once GitHub Actions have been enabled for your copy of this repo, GitHub will automatically run the workflows found under the Actions menu for your repo.

Everytime to commit a change to the repo, the GitHub Actions including FPGA action will trigger the workflow automatically.

A green checkmark shows the workflow completed successfully.  Click on the workflow on the Actions summary page for the workflow.  At the bottom of the page you will find an Artifacts section with a bitstream link.  Click to download locally to your desktop.  Navigate to the downloaded file and click to unpack the zip file and get a 'wokwi.bin' file.

Follow the instruction to program the bitstream on your demo board.

## 7. Programming your bitstream on the FPGA board

### Put your board in 'Boot Mode'

While holding the 'Boot' button on the top carrier board, connect a USB from your desktop to the top carrier to power on the board.  

Release the 'boot' button.

Select from one of the options below to program the bitstream to the board.

### WebUSB DFU

Navigate to the follow web page.

https://devanlai.github.io/webdfu/dfu-util/

Click the 'Connect' button and select the device with 'Tiny Tapeout'.  A pop menu should appear.  Select the 'ICE40' interface.

Click the 'Choose File' button under Firmware Download.  Select the woki.bin file you downloaded previously.  Click the Download button.

Unplug and re-plug the USB in the top carrier to power cycle the board.

### dfu-util for Win64

Download and unzip the following executable...

https://files.ef.link/mest/win64.zip

dfu-util.exe will be installed under /win64

### dfu-util for Mac

brew install dfu-util

### Ubuntu
It's pre-installed… yay… but you don't have permission to use it. To open USB access:

echo 'ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1d50", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6146", MODE="664", GROUP="plugdev", TAG+="uaccess"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/50-usb.rules
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger

## Wokwi Projects
